# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

# Using MySQL with Node and React JS

This tutorial uses the same project files from node_react_mongodb_tutorial, and modified to use with MySQL database instead of MongoDB.

First, install MYSQL using homebrew

For my case since I'm running MacOS Mojave on my Macbook Pro, I'm going to install MySQL version 5.7
```javascript
brew install mysql@5.7
```

I need to force my MacOS to use MySQL version 5.7
```javascript
brew link --force mysql@5.7
```

(optional) Set up a database password if you would like...
```javascript
mysql_secure_installation
```

Start up the MySQL server
```javascript
brew services start mysql@5.7
```

Other useful commands:
```javascript
brew services restart mysql@5.7
brew services list
brew services cleanup
```

Install MySQL as a package dependency inside of the backend folder
```javascript
cd backend
npm install mysql
```

Install MySQL Workbench
```javascript
For my MacOS Mojave, I installed Workbench version 8.0.18
```

MySQL Workbench:
- Create a Connection
- Create a new Schema (voter_db)
- Create tables (votes)

    CREATE TABLE `votes` (
    `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `name` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
    `voting_choice` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
    `casted_at` date NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
    )
